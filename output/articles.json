    "article_content": "# One Big Beautiful Bill Act\n*H.R.1*\n\n## Overview\n\nRep. Jodey C. Arrington [R-TX-19] has sponsored the \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act,\" which aims to reduce taxes, adjust spending for various federal programs, and increase the debt limit. The bill has passed both chambers of Congress with very close votes and was signed into law by the President on July 4, 2025, becoming Public Law No. 119-21. This major reconciliation bill represents a significant legislative victory for the Republican majority, advancing key fiscal policy priorities through a narrow partisan passage that saw intense debate and numerous proposed amendments throughout the legislative process.\n\n## Committee Review\n\nThe bill is currently law, having been reported as an original measure from the [Budget Committee](https://www.congress.gov/committee/budget-committee/hsbu00) in the House of Representatives. This committee, which focuses on federal budgetary issues, played the crucial role of preparing and reporting the legislation. The Committee held two meetings on May 21, 2025, at 1:00 AM and July 1, 2025, at 1:30 PM to consider the measure, producing Committee Reports H. Rept. 119-106, Book 1 and Book 2. These reports detail the committee's findings and recommendations, providing essential context for the floor debates that followed.\n\n## Legislative Sponsorship\n\nThe bill has been introduced by Rep. Jodey C. Arrington of Texas's 19th congressional district, a Republican who serves as the Chairman of the House Budget Committee. For more details about Rep. Arrington's legislative activities and background, you can visit his official Congress.gov page. As chairman, Rep. Arrington had the authority to report this reconciliation legislation as an original measure, bypassing the typical introduction process and allowing for expedited consideration of this high-priority fiscal legislation.\n\n## Congressional Support\n\nThe bill was reported from the [Budget Committee](https://www.congress.gov/committee/budget-committee/hsbu00) in the House of Representatives as an original measure. Notably, no cosponsors have signed onto this legislation, which is typical for budget reconciliation bills that are reported directly from committee rather than being introduced by individual members. The lack of cosponsors reflects the bill's nature as a comprehensive committee product rather than a member-driven initiative, though it garnered support from the Republican caucus during floor votes.\n\n## Committee Proceedings\n\nThe Budget Committee held two committee meetings to consider this legislation. The first occurred on May 21, 2025, at 1:00 AM, and the second on July 1, 2025, at 1:30 PM. These meetings allowed committee members to review the bill's provisions, hear from relevant stakeholders, and make modifications before reporting the measure to the full House. Following these committee deliberations, the bill progressed through both chambers with multiple procedural votes and extensive floor consideration. The House and Senate each conducted numerous votes on amendments and final passage, demonstrating the contentious nature of this major fiscal legislation.\n\n## Proposed Changes\n\nA total of 493 amendments have been proposed for this bill, reflecting the intense legislative interest and debate surrounding its provisions. Among the notable amendments considered in the Senate, Amendment SA 2848 to improve the bill was passed by a narrow margin of 51-50 (Record Vote Number: 370), with portions subsequently stricken by the Chair following a point of order. Another significant amendment, SA 2849, aimed at striking a provision related to delayed implementation of the supplemental nutrition assistance program matching funds requirements, was rejected by a vote of 45-55 (Record Vote Number: 369). Amendment SA 2814, which struck the section relating to support for artificial intelligence, was agreed to by an overwhelming vote of 99-1 (Record Vote Number: 363). Amendment SA 2790, to advance the effective date of eligibility verification requirements from January 1, 2028, to January 1, 2027, was agreed to by voice vote. The vast majority of the 493 amendments submitted remain without recorded votes, having been proposed but not brought to the floor for consideration.\n\n## Voting Record\n\nIn the House of Representatives, the bill was passed on May 22, 2025, with a very close vote of 215 to 214, with 1 member voting present (Roll no. 145). This razor-thin margin demonstrates the intense partisan division surrounding the legislation. The Senate also passed the bill with an amendment by a narrow margin of 51 to 50 on July 1, 2025 (Record Vote Number: 372), following consideration of the Senate substitute amendment SA 2360, which was also agreed to by the same 51-50 vote (Record Vote Number: 371). The motion to proceed to consideration in the Senate was approved 51-49 (Record Vote Number: 329) on June 28, 2025. After Senate passage with amendments, the House agreed to the Senate amendment on July 3, 2025, by a vote of 218-214 (Roll no. 190). The bill was then presented to the President and signed into law on July 4, 2025. Throughout consideration, there were 47 total roll call votes recorded, demonstrating this was a party-line vote with minimal bipartisan support in both chambers.\n"

    "article_content": "# Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2026\n*H.R.5371*\n\n## Overview\n\nRep. Tom Cole [R-OK-4] has introduced the \"Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2026,\" which aims to provide FY2026 funding for federal agencies while extending several expiring programs. The bill is currently stalled in the Senate, where cloture motions have repeatedly failed throughout late October 2025, with close votes indicating strong partisan divides. This continuing resolution represents an attempt to prevent a government shutdown by maintaining current funding levels while lawmakers negotiate a comprehensive appropriations package for the fiscal year.\n\n## Committee Review\n\nThe bill has been referred to two key committees: the [Appropriations Committee](https://www.congress.gov/committee/appropriations-committee/hsap00) and the [Budget Committee](https://www.congress.gov/committee/budget-committee/hsbu00), both in the House of Representatives. These committees are responsible for reviewing the financial aspects of the legislation and making recommendations before it can advance to the full House for consideration. The dual referral reflects the bill's comprehensive nature, touching on both spending authorizations and budget reconciliation matters that fall under the jurisdiction of both committees.\n\n## Legislative Sponsorship\n\nThe bill is sponsored by Representative Tom Cole from Oklahoma's 4th congressional district. A Republican, Rep. Cole brings his extensive experience as Chairman of the House Appropriations Committee to advocate for the legislation. His leadership on appropriations matters makes him a natural choice to guide this critical funding measure through the legislative process. For more details about Rep. Cole's background and other bills he sponsors, you can visit his official Congress.gov profile page.\n\n## Congressional Support\n\nThis bill has not garnered any cosponsors so far. It has been referred to two House committees: the [Appropriations Committee](https://www.congress.gov/committee/appropriations-committee/hsap00) and the [Budget Committee](https://www.congress.gov/committee/budget-committee/hsbu00). These committees are responsible for reviewing the financial aspects of the legislation and making recommendations. The lack of cosponsors is not unusual for continuing resolutions, which are often introduced by committee chairs as part of their leadership responsibilities rather than as collaborative member initiatives.\n\n## Committee Proceedings\n\nSo far, no hearings have been held regarding this bill in Congress. The measure has moved directly to floor consideration in the Senate without traditional committee markup sessions. The Senate has attempted to move the bill forward through cloture motions four times between October 16 and October 28, 2025, but each attempt failed by narrow margins, indicating strong partisan divisions on the issue. These repeated failed cloture votes demonstrate the significant obstacles the legislation faces in advancing through the Senate.\n\n## Proposed Changes\n\nSo far, no amendments have been proposed for this bill. The legislative process remains unchanged with no notable movements or changes suggested by lawmakers as of now. The Senate's inability to invoke cloture has prevented the chamber from reaching the amendment process, leaving the bill in procedural limbo. Without successful cloture, senators cannot offer amendments or move to final passage, effectively stalling the legislation's progress.\n\n## Voting Record\n\nSo far, there have been four votes on this bill in the Senate, all of which were unsuccessful attempts to proceed with cloture. The first cloture motion on October 16, 2025, failed with a vote of 50-43. Subsequent attempts on October 21 resulted in a 50-44 vote, followed by a 53-46 vote on October 23, and most recently a 54-46 vote on October 28, 2025. These close votes, while showing some movement toward the 60-vote threshold required for cloture, ultimately did not manage to invoke cloture for any further action on H.R. 5371. The pattern of these votes indicates a tight partisan divide but did not achieve the supermajority needed to advance the legislation.\n"

    "article_content": "# Pay Our Troops Act of 2026\n*H.R.5401*\n\n## Overview\n\nRep. Jennifer A. Kiggans of Virginia has introduced the Pay Our Troops Act of 2026 in the House, aiming to ensure military pay continues during government shutdowns. Currently, the bill is in Committee and has not yet been voted on by either chamber. This legislation addresses a critical concern for military families who face uncertainty about receiving paychecks during periods of government funding lapses. The bill seeks to provide assurance that active-duty military personnel and essential defense civilian employees would continue to receive their earned compensation regardless of congressional funding disputes.\n\n## Committee Review\n\nThe bill is currently under review by the [Appropriations Committee](https://www.congress.gov/committee/appropriations-committee/hsap00) in the House of Representatives. This committee is responsible for drafting federal spending bills, making it a crucial step in the legislative process for this particular piece of legislation. The Appropriations Committee's jurisdiction over funding matters makes it the appropriate venue for considering legislation that would ensure continued military pay during funding gaps. Committee consideration will determine whether the bill advances to the full House for further debate and voting.\n\n## Legislative Sponsorship\n\nThe bill has been introduced by Representative Jennifer A. Kiggans of Virginia's 2nd district, a Republican. Rep. Kiggans, who represents a district with significant military presence including Naval Station Norfolk and other defense installations, has made military and veteran issues a priority in her congressional service. For more details on Rep. Kiggans and her legislative priorities, you can visit her official congressional page at [https://api.congress.gov/v3/member/K000399?format=json](https://api.congress.gov/v3/member/K000399?format=json).\n\n## Congressional Support\n\nThe bill has been cosponsored by several Republican representatives from different states, including Reps. Fitzpatrick (PA-1), Mace (SC-1), Kean (NJ-7), Crenshaw (TX-2), and Nunn (IA-3). It has also garnered support from other Republicans like Reps. Luna (FL-13), Wittman (VA-1), Boebert (CO-4), and Huizenga (MI-4). The bill is currently being handled by the [Appropriations Committee](https://www.congress.gov/committee/appropriations-committee/hsap00). The bipartisan nature of military pay protection has historically led to broad support, though this particular bill's cosponsorship remains within Republican ranks as of now.\n\n## Committee Proceedings\n\nAs of now, no hearings have been held regarding this bill, and there are currently no findings to report. The bill has not yet garnered any votes in Congress, with zero scheduled hearings or other committee actions to date. The Appropriations Committee has not announced plans for markup sessions or testimony from military leaders, defense officials, or other stakeholders. The bill remains in the early stages of the legislative process, awaiting committee action before it can advance to floor consideration.\n\n## Proposed Changes\n\nAs of now, no amendments have been proposed for this bill. The congressional committee has not received any suggested changes to the legislation, leaving it in its original form for consideration. As the bill has not yet reached the amendment stage of the legislative process, it remains as initially drafted by Rep. Kiggans and her staff. Should the bill advance to committee markup or floor consideration, amendments could be offered to modify its provisions, expand or narrow its scope, or address technical concerns raised during the review process.\n\n## Voting Record\n\nAs of now, no votes have been cast on this bill, according to available information. The bill has not yet undergone any hearings or procedural steps in Congress. Without committee action or floor consideration, there have been no opportunities for members to vote on the legislation. The bill remains pending in the Appropriations Committee, awaiting scheduling for further legislative action that would move it through the committee process and potentially to the House floor for votes on passage.\n"

    "article_content": "# National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2026\n*S.2296*\n\n## Overview\n\nSen. Roger Wicker, R-MS, has sponsored the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2026, which recently passed in the Senate with a strong bipartisan vote of 77 to 20 on October 9, 2025. The bill now moves to conference with the House to reconcile differences between the two chambers' versions, setting policies and authorities for Department of Defense programs, including funding for various military procurements and construction projects, as well as extending key defense initiatives through the next fiscal year. This comprehensive defense authorization represents one of the few bills that Congress passes annually, making it a critical vehicle for establishing defense policy, military priorities, and national security strategies for the upcoming fiscal year.\n\n## Committee Review\n\nThe bill is an original measure reported from the [Armed Services Committee](https://www.congress.gov/committee/armed-services-committee/ssas00) in the Senate. This committee focuses on defense and military-related legislation, ensuring that it aligns with national security needs. Senator Wicker, as Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, reported this measure as an original bill with written report No. 119-39 on July 15, 2025, which provides detailed analysis and recommendations on the legislation's provisions. An errata sheet on the written report was subsequently printed on July 15, 2025, to correct any technical or clerical errors in the committee's analysis. The committee passed the bill by a vote of 26-1, with Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) casting the sole dissenting vote.\n\n## Legislative Sponsorship\n\nThe bill is sponsored by Sen. Roger F. Wicker from Mississippi, a Republican representing the state's interests in Congress. As Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator Wicker has extensive experience with defense policy and military affairs, having served on the committee for years and played a crucial role in shaping annual defense legislation. His leadership on the committee positions him to guide this critical annual legislation through the Senate, working with both Republican and Democratic members to craft a bill that addresses national security priorities. For more details about Senator Wicker and his work on defense matters, you can visit his official congressional page at [https://api.congress.gov/v3/member/W000437?format=json](https://api.congress.gov/v3/member/W000437?format=json).\n\n## Congressional Support\n\nThe bill was reported to the Senate by the [Armed Services Committee](https://www.congress.gov/committee/armed-services-committee/ssas00) as an original measure. As is typical for committee-reported original measures, no cosponsors have signed onto this legislation. The bill represents the collective work of the Armed Services Committee rather than an individual member initiative, which explains the absence of traditional cosponsors. The committee's bipartisan consideration and markup process means the measure reflects input from both Republican and Democratic committee members, even without formal cosponsorship. The strong 26-1 committee vote and the overwhelming 77-20 Senate passage demonstrate broad bipartisan support for the legislation's defense priorities.\n\n## Committee Proceedings\n\nThe Senate Armed Services Committee reported this bill as an original measure with written report No. 119-39 on July 15, 2025. The committee conducted extensive deliberations throughout the spring and summer of 2025, holding numerous hearings on defense priorities, receiving testimony from military leaders including service chiefs and combatant commanders, hearing from defense officials and national security experts, and negotiating among committee members to craft bipartisan provisions. The motion to proceed to consideration of the measure was made in the Senate on August 2, 2025, with a cloture motion on that motion to proceed also presented on the same date. Floor consideration began in early September, with the Senate voting 84-14 on September 4, 2025, to proceed to the bill, demonstrating strong bipartisan support for moving forward with debate and amendments.\n\n## Proposed Changes\n\nA total of 649 amendments have been filed to this bill, reflecting the intense legislative interest and broad scope of defense policy covered in the annual authorization. Several notable amendments were adopted during Senate consideration. Amendment SA 3928, to require the Secretary of Defense to establish a pilot program for deploying microreactors, was agreed to by voice vote. Amendment SA 3927, aimed at limiting the use of Federal law enforcement officers for crowd control, was not agreed to in the Senate with a vote of 47-50 (Record Vote Number: 527). Amendment SA 3926, to protect national security by imposing sanctions with respect to certain persons of the People's Republic of China and prohibiting certain investments, was agreed to by the Senate. Amendment SA 3841, containing the text of the BIOSECURE Act, was adopted and would prevent federal agencies and contractors from using biotechnology equipment or services provided by companies owned or controlled by foreign adversary governments. The Senate also adopted SA 3272, the Law Enforcement and Crime Victims Support Package, by voice vote, which includes eight bills that were favorably reported by the Judiciary Committee. The vast majority of the 649 amendments filed were not brought to the floor for votes, though several dozen received recorded votes during the extended Senate debate.\n\n## Voting Record\n\nThe bill saw extensive floor consideration with multiple procedural and substantive votes throughout September and early October 2025. The motion to proceed to consideration passed on September 4, 2025, by a strong bipartisan vote of 84-14 (Record Vote Number: 503), demonstrating broad support for moving forward with the defense authorization. The Senate held 12 recorded roll call votes during consideration of the bill and its amendments. The final passage vote occurred on October 9, 2025, at 8:59 PM, with the bill passing 77 to 20 (Record Vote Number: 570), significantly exceeding the 60-vote threshold required under the Senate's agreement. This bipartisan vote demonstrates strong support from both parties for the defense authorization, with 77 senators voting in favor and only 20 voting against. The bill now moves to conference with the House, which passed its own version of the NDAA (H.R. 3838) on September 10, 2025, by a vote of 231-196. The two chambers will need to reconcile their differences, including a $32 billion gap in topline spending authorization, before sending a final version to the President.\n"

Mike Crapo (R-ID) has introduced a bill to rename the Jerome, Idaho post office in honor of Representative Maxine Bell, a distinguished Idaho state legislator who served for decades in the Idaho House of Representatives. Currently, the bill is pending in the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs after being referred there on January 7, 2025. No votes or hearings have taken place yet as the bill moves through its early stages. Post office naming bills are traditionally non-controversial and often pass with bipartisan support as a way to honor individuals who have made significant contributions to their communities and states.\n\n## Committee Review\n\nThe bill is currently under review by the [Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee](https://www.congress.gov/committee/homeland-security-and-governmental-affairs-committee/ssga00) in the Senate. This committee focuses on issues related to homeland security and federal government operations, including the oversight of postal facilities and their naming. The committee's jurisdiction over postal matters makes it the appropriate venue for considering legislation to rename federal post office buildings. Committee consideration will determine whether the bill is reported favorably to the full Senate for further action.\n\n## Legislative Sponsorship\n\nThe bill in question has been introduced by Sen. Mike Crapo of Idaho, a Republican. With decades of experience representing Idaho's interests in Congress, Sen. Crapo leads this legislative effort to honor a respected state legislator. Representative Maxine Bell served in the Idaho House of Representatives with distinction, making her a fitting honoree for this postal facility designation. Senator Crapo's sponsorship reflects his commitment to recognizing Idaho citizens who have made lasting contributions to public service.\n\n## Congressional Support\n\nSen. James E. Risch from Idaho is the sole cosponsor of this bill so far. The legislation has been referred to the [Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee](https://www.congress.gov/committee/homeland-security-and-governmental-affairs-committee/ssga00) in the Senate. As of now, no committee members beyond Idaho's senatorial delegation have joined as cosponsors, though such bills typically attract additional support as they move through the legislative process. The bipartisan tradition of honoring distinguished citizens through postal facility naming suggests the bill may gain broader support if it advances from committee.\n\n## Committee Proceedings\n\nSo far, no hearings have been held regarding this bill. The lack of committee action means there are currently no findings to report. With zero votes cast, the bill remains in an early stage of development with no public testimony or discussion to share at this time. Post office naming bills typically do not require extensive hearings or markup sessions, as they are largely ceremonial in nature and rarely generate controversy. The committee may choose to approve the bill through an expedited process without formal hearings.\n\n## Proposed Changes\n\nSo far, no amendments have been proposed for this bill. The legislative process remains unchanged with no notable proposals or changes submitted by lawmakers to alter the current version of the legislation. The straightforward nature of post office naming bills means amendments are uncommon, as the legislation typically contains simple language designating a specific facility with a specific name. Should the bill advance to floor consideration, technical amendments might be offered to correct any clerical errors or clarify the facility's location.\n\n## Voting Record\n\nAs of now, no votes have taken place on the bill in question, according to available information. The bill has not yet undergone any hearings or procedural steps in Congress, leaving its fate uncertain at this stage. Once the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee acts on the legislation, it could move to the Senate floor for consideration under unanimous consent, which is the typical path for non-controversial post office naming bills. Final passage would require approval by both the Senate and House of Representatives before being sent to the President for signature.\n"

    "article_content": "# Continuing Appropriations and Extensions and Other Matters Act, 2026\n*S.2882*\n\n## Overview\n\nSen. Patty Murray's (D-WA) bill, titled \"Continuing Appropriations and Extensions and Other Matters Act, 2026,\" aims to prevent a government shutdown by providing FY2026 funding for federal agencies and extending various health care and security provisions. The bill has faced significant hurdles in the Senate, with cloture motions failing multiple times throughout late September and early October 2025, ultimately failing final passage on September 30, 2025, leaving its fate sealed as unsuccessful legislation. This continuing resolution represented a Democratic attempt to maintain government operations and extend key programs, but partisan divisions prevented its advancement.\n\n## Committee Review\n\nThe bill in question has not been assigned to any committees. Without being referred to the appropriate committee or committees, the legislation proceeded directly to the Senate floor under leadership prerogatives. This direct-to-floor approach is sometimes used for urgent appropriations measures when time is limited before a government funding deadline. However, the lack of committee consideration also means the bill did not benefit from the detailed review and potential improvements that typically occur during the committee process.\n\n## Legislative Sponsorship\n\nThe bill is sponsored by Sen. Patty Murray from Washington (D-WA). As a member of the Democratic party and Chair or Ranking Member of the Senate Appropriations Committee (depending on majority control), Sen. Murray represents Washington in the U.S. Senate and has taken the lead on this legislative effort. Her extensive experience with appropriations matters and government funding issues makes her a natural choice to champion continuing resolution legislation aimed at preventing government shutdowns.\n\n## Congressional Support\n\nSo far, no members of Congress have cosponsored this bill, and it has not been assigned to any committees for consideration. The bill currently stands alone in the legislative process with neither additional sponsors nor a committee to oversee its development. The lack of cosponsors may reflect the partisan nature of the legislation or the expedited timeline under which it was introduced and considered. Continuing resolutions introduced near funding deadlines often lack the traditional collaborative development process that would generate cosponsorship.\n\n## Committee Proceedings\n\nNo hearings were held for this bill. The bill faced significant challenges in the Senate, with multiple cloture motions failing to achieve the necessary 60 votes required to advance the legislation. The first cloture attempt on September 26, 2025, failed with a vote of 47-52. Subsequent attempts on September 27 (47-52), September 29 (46-52), and September 30 (47-53) also failed to reach the threshold. Despite these efforts, the final passage vote on September 30, 2025, also failed, resulting in the bill not advancing and the risk of a government shutdown looming.\n\n## Proposed Changes\n\nSo far, no amendments have been proposed for this bill. The legislative process has not seen any significant changes or additions suggested by lawmakers as of now. The repeated failure to invoke cloture prevented the Senate from reaching the amendment process, where senators could have offered modifications to the legislation. Without successful cloture votes, the bill remained in procedural limbo, unable to advance to the stage where amendments could be considered and voted upon.\n\n## Voting Record\n\nThe bill faced significant challenges in the Senate, with votes occurring multiple times but ultimately failing to pass. The cloture motion on September 26, 2025, failed 47-52, followed by another failed cloture vote on September 27, 2025, with the same 47-52 margin. On September 29, 2025, a third cloture attempt failed 46-52. Finally, on September 30, 2025, both a fourth cloture motion (47-53) and the final passage vote (47-53) failed, with no party showing overwhelming support. These divided votes indicated close and contentious debate without achieving the necessary supermajority for cloture or simple majority for passage, demonstrating the partisan nature of appropriations disputes.\n"

    "article_content": "# Government Shutdown Prevention Act of 2025\n*S.499*\n\n## Overview\n\nSen. Rand Paul (R-KY) has introduced the Government Shutdown Prevention Act of 2025 to prevent government shutdowns by providing continuing appropriations automatically when Congress fails to pass regular appropriations bills by the start of a fiscal year. Currently in Committee, the bill was read twice and referred to the Committee on Appropriations on February 10, 2025. No hearings or votes have been held yet as the bill is still in its early stages of consideration. This legislation represents an attempt to create an automatic mechanism that would keep the government operating at prior-year funding levels rather than forcing shutdowns during appropriations impasses.\n\n## Committee Review\n\nThe bill is currently under review by the [Appropriations Committee](https://www.congress.gov/committee/appropriations-committee/ssap00) in the Senate. This committee is responsible for federal spending and funding decisions, making it a crucial step in the legislative process for this particular piece of legislation. The Appropriations Committee's jurisdiction over government funding matters makes it the natural venue for considering legislation that would fundamentally alter how the government handles funding lapses. Committee consideration will determine whether the bill advances or remains in committee without further action.\n\n## Legislative Sponsorship\n\nThe bill in question has been introduced by Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky (R-KY). A Republican from Kentucky known for his libertarian views and fiscal conservatism, Sen. Paul has been a vocal critic of certain government spending practices and shutdown politics. His proposal seeks to remove the threat of government shutdowns as a negotiating tactic by automatically continuing government operations. For more details on Sen. Paul's background and other bills he sponsors, you can visit his official congressional page at [https://api.congress.gov/v3/member/P000603?format=json](https://api.congress.gov/v3/member/P000603?format=json).\n\n## Congressional Support\n\nThe bill was referred to the [Appropriations Committee](https://www.congress.gov/committee/appropriations-committee/ssap00), which operates under the Senate. Unfortunately, no cosponsors have signed onto this legislation so far. The lack of cosponsorship may reflect the controversial nature of automatic continuing resolutions, which some lawmakers view as removing necessary pressure to complete regular appropriations work on time. The bill represents Senator Paul's individual initiative rather than a collaborative effort with other members at this stage.\n\n## Committee Proceedings\n\nSo far, no hearings have been held regarding this bill, and there are currently no findings to report. The bill has not yet received any votes or undergone procedural actions in Congress. The Appropriations Committee has not scheduled markup sessions or hearings to consider the legislation's merits and potential impacts. Without committee action, the bill remains pending in the early stages of the legislative process, awaiting decisions by committee leadership about whether to advance it for further consideration.\n\n## Proposed Changes\n\nSo far, no amendments have been proposed for this bill. The congressional records indicate that there are currently no pending or withdrawn amendments to report, and no notable amendments have surfaced as of now. As the bill has not advanced to the amendment stage of the legislative process, it remains in its originally introduced form. Should the bill move forward to committee markup or floor consideration, amendments could be offered to modify its automatic continuing resolution provisions, adjust funding levels, or address concerns about removing shutdown pressure from appropriations negotiations.\n\n## Voting Record\n\nAs of now, no votes have been held on the bill in question, according to available information. The bill has not yet reached a stage where it could be debated or passed by Congress, with zero recorded procedural, passage, cloture, amendment, or motion to table votes. Additionally, there have been no hearings or markup sessions related to this legislation. The bill remains in committee awaiting action, with no scheduled votes or procedural movements on the Senate calendar at this time.\n"

    "article_content": "# An executive resolution authorizing the en bloc consideration in Executive Session of certain nominations on the Executive Calendar.\n*S.Res.412*\n\n## Overview\n\n[Sen. Thune, John [R-SD]](https://www.congress.gov/member/thune,-john-[r-sd]/T000250), has sponsored an executive resolution in the Senate to authorize en bloc consideration of certain nominations in Executive Session. The resolution passed the Senate by a vote of 51-46 on October 3, 2025, after invoking cloture on October 1, 2025, with a vote of 53-46. This procedural resolution streamlines the confirmation process by allowing the Senate to consider multiple nominations together rather than individually, expediting the approval process for executive and judicial branch positions that have been pending before the Senate.\n\n## Committee Review\n\nAs of now, this resolution has not been assigned to any committees in Congress. Executive resolutions dealing with Senate procedures and the consideration of nominations do not follow the traditional committee referral process. Instead, they are handled directly on the Senate floor under the chamber's rules governing executive business. Without committee referral, the resolution proceeded directly to floor consideration where it was debated and voted upon by the full Senate membership.\n\n## Legislative Sponsorship\n\nThe resolution was introduced by Sen. John Thune [R-SD]. As a Republican from South Dakota and member of Senate Republican leadership, Sen. Thune has taken the lead on this legislative effort to expedite the confirmation process. His position in leadership gives him the authority and responsibility to manage floor procedures and facilitate the efficient processing of executive nominations. Senator Thune's sponsorship reflects the majority party's interest in advancing pending nominations that have been awaiting Senate action.\n\n## Congressional Support\n\nAs of now, this resolution does not have any cosponsors or committee assignments. Executive resolutions are typically introduced by the Majority Leader or other leadership members and proceed directly to floor consideration without the traditional cosponsorship process seen in legislation. The resolution remains a leadership-driven procedural measure rather than a collaborative member initiative. Its consideration and passage depend on majority party support and the willingness of the minority to allow expedited processing of nominations.\n\n## Committee Proceedings\n\nThe resolution underwent Senate floor consideration rather than traditional committee proceedings. Executive resolutions authorizing en bloc consideration of nominations do not require committee hearings or markup sessions. The Senate considered the resolution through its executive session procedures, beginning with a cloture motion filed on October 1, 2025, which was subsequently invoked with a vote of 53-46. Following successful cloture, the Senate proceeded to final passage of the resolution on October 3, 2025. The procedural votes demonstrate the partisan nature of the confirmation process and the challenges in achieving consensus on executive nominations.\n\n## Proposed Changes\n\nTwo amendments were offered to this resolution during Senate consideration. Amendment SA 3918 and Amendment SA 3919 were both submitted, though specific details about their content and sponsors are not immediately available in the public record. Both amendments remained in pending status without receiving floor votes. The nature of executive resolutions and the time constraints under which they are often considered may have limited opportunities for amendment consideration. The Senate ultimately passed the underlying resolution without adopting either proposed amendment.\n\n## Voting Record\n\nThe resolution saw several votes in the Senate, with all of them resulting in close party-line decisions. The cloture motion on October 1, 2025, passed by a margin of 53-46, achieving the 60-vote threshold required to invoke cloture and limit debate. The final passage vote on October 3, 2025, succeeded with a vote of 51-46, requiring only a simple majority for adoption. These results indicate that the resolution faced significant partisan divisions throughout its consideration, with minimal crossover support from minority party members. The close votes demonstrate the contentious nature of executive nominations and the procedures used to process them.\n"

    "article_content": "# Impeaching Donald John Trump, President of the United States, for high crimes and misdemeanors.\n*H.Res.353*\n\n## Overview\n\nRep. Shri Thanedar of Michigan has introduced a resolution to impeach President Donald Trump for high crimes and misdemeanors, including obstruction of justice and abuse of power. Currently, the resolution is in committee, with no further action taken since Rep. Thanedar notified the House of his intent to offer the privileged resolution on May 13, 2025. The resolution represents one member's effort to initiate impeachment proceedings, though it has not advanced through the legislative process nor garnered significant support from other members of Congress.\n\n## Committee Review\n\nThe resolution is currently under review by the [Judiciary Committee](https://www.congress.gov/committee/judiciary-committee/hsju00) in the House of Representatives. This committee is responsible for considering legislation related to the justice system, including laws affecting courts, civil rights, and constitutional matters such as impeachment. The Judiciary Committee's jurisdiction over impeachment makes it the appropriate venue for initial consideration of any impeachment resolution. The committee would need to hold hearings, gather evidence, and vote on articles of impeachment before the resolution could advance to the full House.\n\n## Legislative Sponsorship\n\nThe resolution is sponsored by Representative Shri Thanedar from Michigan's 13th district, a Democrat. Rep. Thanedar represents the Detroit area and has been an active member of the House since taking office. For more details about Rep. Thanedar and his legislative activities, you can visit his official congressional page. His decision to introduce this impeachment resolution reflects his assessment of constitutional violations that he believes warrant removal of the President from office.\n\n## Congressional Support\n\nThe resolution was initially cosponsored by Rep. Al Green from Texas's 9th district when it was introduced on April 28, 2025. However, four original cosponsors—Reps. Jerrold Nadler (NY-12), Robin Kelly (IL-2), Kweisi Mfume (MD-7), and Jan Schakowsky (IL-9)—subsequently withdrew their cosponsorship. As of the latest information, Rep. Al Green remains the sole cosponsor. The resolution is currently under review by the [Judiciary Committee](https://www.congress.gov/committee/judiciary-committee/hsju00) in the House of Representatives. The withdrawal of multiple cosponsors suggests evolving political considerations and the controversial nature of impeachment proceedings.\n\n## Committee Proceedings\n\nSo far, no hearings have been held regarding this resolution, and there has been no floor consideration in Congress. On May 13, 2025, Rep. Thanedar notified the House of his intent to offer the privileged resolution pursuant to House rules, and the Chair announced that a determination would be made at the time designated for consideration of the resolution. The resolution remains at an early stage with no votes recorded as of yet. The lack of committee activity suggests the resolution has not been prioritized for consideration by the Judiciary Committee leadership.\n\n## Proposed Changes\n\nSo far, no amendments have been proposed for this resolution, according to available information. The congressional record indicates there are currently zero pending or withdrawn amendments, as well as no adopted or rejected ones at this time. As an impeachment resolution, the text sets forth specific articles of impeachment outlining alleged high crimes and misdemeanors. Should the resolution advance to committee consideration, members could propose amendments to add, remove, or modify the articles of impeachment before the committee votes on whether to report the resolution to the full House.\n\n## Voting Record\n\nAs of now, no votes have been cast on the resolution in question, according to available information. There have been no hearings or procedural actions taken, leaving the status of this legislation unclear at this time. The resolution remains referred to the Judiciary Committee without being scheduled for markup, hearing, or floor consideration. For an impeachment resolution to advance, it would require committee approval followed by a floor vote in the full House of Representatives, neither of which have occurred for this resolution.\n"

    "article_content": "# Full-Year Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2025\n*H.R.1968*\n\n## Overview\n\nRep. Tom Cole [R-OK-4] sponsored the \"Full-Year Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2025,\" a bill that was signed into law on March 15, 2025, becoming Public Law No. 119-4. The legislation provided FY2025 appropriations for federal agencies and extended several expiring programs, successfully averting a government shutdown for the remainder of fiscal year 2025. After passing both chambers of Congress with relatively close votes that demonstrated partisan divisions on spending priorities, the bill became law and ensured continued government operations through September 30, 2025.\n\n## Committee Review\n\nThe bill was referred to two key committees: the [Appropriations Committee](https://www.congress.gov/committee/appropriations-committee/hsap00) and the [Budget Committee](https://www.congress.gov/committee/budget-committee/hsbu00), both in the House of Representatives. These committees reviewed the financial aspects of the legislation before it advanced to the House floor. The dual committee referral reflects the bill's comprehensive nature, addressing both discretionary spending levels under the Appropriations Committee's jurisdiction and budget reconciliation matters that fall within the Budget Committee's purview. The committees' review ensured the legislation complied with budgetary rules and spending limits.\n\n## Legislative Sponsorship\n\nThe bill is sponsored by Representative Tom Cole from Oklahoma's 4th congressional district, a Republican who serves as Chairman of the House Appropriations Committee. His leadership position makes him responsible for shepherding major appropriations legislation through the House. For more details about Rep. Cole's background, legislative priorities, and appropriations work, you can visit his official Congress.gov page. Chairman Cole's extensive experience with federal spending matters and his relationships with members on both sides of the aisle proved crucial in negotiating a continuing resolution that could pass both chambers.\n\n## Congressional Support\n\nThis bill has not gained any cosponsors. It was referred to two House committees: the [Appropriations Committee](https://www.congress.gov/committee/appropriations-committee/hsap00) and the [Budget Committee](https://www.congress.gov/committee/budget-committee/hsbu00). Both committees play crucial roles in shaping the legislation's direction and potential impact. The absence of cosponsors is typical for continuing resolutions and appropriations bills introduced by committee chairs, as these measures represent the product of committee work and leadership negotiations rather than individual member initiatives requiring collaborative sponsorship.\n\n## Committee Proceedings\n\nThe bill moved rapidly through the legislative process without traditional committee hearings or markup sessions. After being introduced on March 10, 2025, the House Rules Committee reported a rule (H. Res. 211) on March 11, 2025, providing for consideration of H.R. 1968 under a closed rule with one hour of general debate and one motion to recommit. The expedited process reflected the urgent need to pass appropriations legislation before existing government funding expired. The bill was considered on the House floor on March 11, 2025, and subsequently moved to the Senate, which considered it on March 14, 2025, with cloture invoked by a vote of 62-38.\n\n## Proposed Changes\n\nA total of 23 amendments were proposed to the bill during Senate consideration. One House amendment (H.Amdt.8) was considered adopted pursuant to H. Res. 211, incorporating modifications printed in House Report 119-15. In the Senate, several amendments received floor votes. Amendment SA 1266, to reduce funding for the United States Agency for International Development, was rejected 27-73 (Record Vote Number: 132). Amendment SA 1274, aimed at providing veteran Federal employees dismissed without cause with reinstatement eligibility, failed to achieve the required 60 votes, being rejected 47-53 (Record Vote Number: 130). Amendment SA 1272, to prohibit use of appropriated amounts by DOGE, was rejected 48-52 (Record Vote Number: 131). Amendment SA 1273, to except certain rescissions, was rejected 47-53 (Record Vote Number: 129). Most amendments proposed did not receive floor votes.\n\n## Voting Record\n\nThe bill saw several votes in both chambers of Congress during its consideration. In the House, it passed on March 11, 2025, by a vote of 217 to 213 (Roll no. 70), with a motion to recommit failing 213-216 (Roll no. 69). In the Senate, cloture was invoked on March 14, 2025, with a strong bipartisan vote of 62-38 (Record Vote Number: 128), allowing the chamber to proceed to final consideration. The Senate then passed the measure without amendment on March 14, 2025, by a vote of 54 to 46 (Record Vote Number: 133). The bill was presented to the President on March 14, 2025, and signed into law on March 15, 2025. The voting patterns demonstrate that while the bill ultimately passed with some bipartisan support, particularly on the Senate cloture vote, the final passage votes in both chambers showed significant partisan divisions on the appropriations measure.\n"
