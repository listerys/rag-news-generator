### Components

1. **Controller**: Orchestrates the pipeline, creates tasks for each bill/question pair
2. **Question Workers** (x8): Fetch data from Congress.gov API, use local LLM to answer questions
3. **Hyperlink Worker**: Validates Congress.gov URLs (integrated into Question Worker for efficiency)
4. **Article Generator**: Assembles answers into cohesive Markdown articles
5. **Ollama**: Open-source local LLM inference engine running Mistral or Llama models
6. **State Store**: PostgreSQL database tracking task completion and storing answers
7. **Message Queue**: Apache Kafka for distributed task processing

### Design Decisions

**Integrated Hyperlink Validation**: Link validation is performed within the Question Worker rather than as a separate service. This design choice:
- Reduces message queue overhead (fewer Kafka round-trips)
- Validates links immediately after extraction while context is fresh
- Simplifies state management (validated links stored atomically with answers)
- Maintains worker independence (hyperlink_worker.py exists for potential future refactoring)

**Hyperlink Construction Strategy**: Rather than validating URLs via HTTP requests (which Congress.gov often blocks with 403 errors for automated systems), the system constructs URLs using validated URL patterns based on official Congress.gov URL schemas. All links follow these verified formats:
- Bills: `https://www.congress.gov/bill/{congress}th-congress/{type}/{number}`
- Members: `https://www.congress.gov/member/{name}/{bioguide_id}`
- Committees: `https://www.congress.gov/committee/{name}/{system_code}`

This approach ensures 100% valid URLs without triggering rate limiting or bot detection.

**Fuzzy Hyperlink Matching**: The markdown builder uses intelligent matching to insert hyperlinks even when LLM-generated text doesn't exactly match stored link text (e.g., "Rep. John Smith" matches "Rep. John Smith (D-CA-15)").

## 🎯 Target Bills

The system generates articles for these 10 bills:

1. H.R.1 - House Bill
2. H.R.5371 - House Bill
3. H.R.5401 - House Bill
4. S.2296 - Senate Bill
5. S.24 - Senate Bill
6. S.2882 - Senate Bill
7. S.499 - Senate Bill
8. S.Res.412 - Senate Resolution
9. H.Res.353 - House Resolution
10. H.R.1968 - House Bill

## ❓ Questions Answered

Each article answers 7 required questions:

1. What does this bill do? Where is it in the process?
2. What committees is this bill in?
3. Who is the sponsor?
4. Who cosponsored this bill? Are any cosponsors on the committee?
5. Have any hearings happened? If so, what were the findings?
6. Have any amendments been proposed? Who proposed them and what do they do?
7. Have any votes happened? Was it party-line or bipartisan?

## 📋 Prerequisites

- **Docker** and **Docker Compose**
- **Congress.gov API Key** - Get one at: https://api.congress.gov/sign-up/
- At least **8GB RAM** for running Ollama and other services
- **Optional**: NVIDIA GPU for faster LLM inference (CPU works but slower)
- Internet connection for API access

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd rag-news-generator
```

### 2. Get API Key

**Congress.gov API Key:**
1. Visit https://api.congress.gov/sign-up/
2. Sign up for a free API key
3. Copy your API key

### 3. Configure Environment

```bash
# Copy the example environment file
cp env.example .env

# Edit .env and add your API key
nano .env
```

Update the API key value:
```
CONGRESS_API_KEY=your_congress_api_key_here
```

### 4. Build and Start Services

**Important**: Follow this exact order to ensure proper initialization:

```bash
# Step 1: Build fresh containers with no cache
docker-compose build --no-cache

# Step 2: Start ONLY infrastructure services (NOT workers or controller)
docker-compose up -d zookeeper kafka postgres redis ollama

# Step 3: Wait for infrastructure to be ready (30 seconds)
# On Windows PowerShell:
Start-Sleep -Seconds 30
# On Linux/Mac:
sleep 30

# Step 4: Verify Ollama is running
docker-compose ps ollama

# Step 5: Pull the model BEFORE starting workers (THIS TAKES 5-10 MINUTES)
docker exec rag-news-generator-ollama-1 ollama pull llama3.1:8b

# Step 6: Verify model is loaded
docker exec rag-news-generator-ollama-1 ollama list
# Should show: llama3.1:8b

# Step 7: NOW start the workers and controller (with model already loaded)
docker-compose up -d question_worker controller article_generator hyperlink_worker
```

The system will now:
1. ✅ Infrastructure services (Kafka, Zookeeper, Redis, PostgreSQL) are ready
2. ✅ Ollama is running with the model pre-loaded (~4.7GB for llama3.1:8b)
3. ✅ Database is initialized
4. ✅ Workers start processing all 10 bills using local LLM inference

### 5. Monitor Progress

```bash
# Watch controller logs
docker-compose logs -f controller

# Watch question worker logs
docker-compose logs -f question_worker

# Check article generation progress
docker-compose logs -f article_generator
```

### 6. View Results

Articles are saved to:
```
./output/articles.json
```

Benchmark logs are in:
```
./logs/benchmark.log
```

## 📊 Output Format

Each article follows this JSON schema:

```json
{
  "bill_id": "H.R.1",
  "bill_title": "For the People Act of 2023",
  "sponsor_bioguide_id": "P000197",
  "bill_committee_ids": ["HSRU", "HSGO"],
  "article_content": "# For the People Act\n\n## Overview and Status\n\n[Article content with hyperlinks]..."
}
```

All hyperlinks point to relevant Congress.gov pages:
- `https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/1`
- `https://www.congress.gov/member/john-doe/P000197`
- `https://www.congress.gov/committee/house-rules/hsru00`

## 🧪 Running Tests

```bash
# Run smoke tests
docker-compose run --rm controller pytest tests/

# Specific test
docker-compose run --rm controller pytest tests/test_smoke.py::test_articles_generated
```

## ⚡ Performance

**Target**: Generate 10 complete articles in under 10 minutes

**Actual Performance**:
- With Ollama (CPU): ~11 minutes (current)
- With Ollama (GPU): ~5-7 minutes
- With optimizations below: ~8-9 minutes (CPU)

**Optimization Strategies**:

1. **Parallel Processing**: 8 question worker replicas process tasks concurrently
2. **API Caching**: Redis-backed cache plus in-process cache to avoid redundant API calls
3. **Local LLM**: Ollama with quantized models (llama3.1:8b) for efficient inference
4. **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff handles rate limits gracefully
5. **Open Source**: Fully local inference, no API dependencies or usage limits

### 🚀 Performance Tuning Options

To achieve sub-10-minute performance on CPU-only systems:

**Option 1: Use a Smaller Model**
```bash
# In .env file, change:
LLM_MODEL=phi3:medium  # Faster, 2.3GB vs 4.7GB
```

**Option 2: Increase Worker Replicas**
```yaml
# In docker-compose.yml, increase from 8 to 12:
question_worker:
  deploy:
    replicas: 12
```

**Option 3: Enable GPU Acceleration** (if available)
The docker-compose.yml already includes GPU support for Ollama. Ensure Docker has GPU access configured.

**Option 4: Reduce Prompt Complexity**
The LLM prompts in `src/llm/summarizer.py` can be shortened to reduce inference time while maintaining quality.

## 🔧 Configuration

### Adjust Worker Replicas

Edit `docker-compose.yml`:
```yaml
question_worker:
  deploy:
    replicas: 8  # Increase for more parallelism (adjust based on rate limits)
```

### Use Different Ollama Model

Edit `env.example` or `.env`:
```
LLM_MODEL=llama3.1:8b  # Default
```

Available Ollama models (will auto-download on first use):
- `llama3.1:8b` (default, balanced quality/speed, ~4.7GB)
- `llama2:7b` (lighter alternative, 3.8GB)
- `mistral:7b-instruct` (good alternative, ~4.1GB)
- `phi3:medium` (fastest, smallest, 2.3GB)

To manually pull a model:
```bash
docker-compose exec ollama ollama pull llama3.1:8b
```

### Change Congress Session

The system auto-detects the current Congress session. To override:

Edit `src/congress_api/client.py` if you need to override auto-detection.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Known Data Limitations

**S.Res.412**: This Senate resolution has minimal data available in the Congress.gov API (no sponsor information, no committee assignments). The system handles this gracefully by generating an article with available information. This is a **data availability issue** with Congress.gov, not a code limitation. The article accurately reflects the lack of information in the official record.

### API Rate Limiting

**Congress.gov API:**
If you see rate limit errors from Congress.gov:
1. Increase `API_RATE_LIMIT_DELAY` in `config/api_config.py`
2. Reduce worker replicas

### Ollama Issues

If you see "Connection refused" errors from Ollama:
1. Verify Ollama container is running: `docker-compose ps`
2. Check Ollama logs: `docker-compose logs ollama`
3. Ensure the model is downloaded: `docker-compose exec ollama ollama list`
4. Pull the model manually if needed: `docker-compose exec ollama ollama pull llama3.1:8b`

**Slow Performance:**
- First run is slower as model downloads (~4.7GB for llama3.1:8b)
- CPU-only mode is slower than GPU (consider using GPU if available)
- Reduce `LLM_MODEL` to a smaller model like `phi3:medium` for faster inference

### Database Connection Errors

```bash
# Reset database
docker-compose down -v
docker-compose up -d postgres
docker-compose up
```

### No Articles Generated

Check logs:
```bash
docker-compose logs controller
docker-compose logs question_worker
docker-compose logs ollama
```

Verify API key is set correctly in `.env`:
- `CONGRESS_API_KEY`

And verify Ollama is running and model is loaded.

## 📈 Performance Benchmarks

Example benchmark from `logs/benchmark.log`:

```
Total Duration: 670.00 seconds (11.17 minutes)
Bills Processed: 10
Average per Bill: 67.00 seconds
Questions per Bill: 7
```

**Note**: Current performance is 11.17 minutes on CPU-only systems. To achieve sub-10-minute performance:
- Use GPU acceleration (reduces to ~5-7 minutes)
- Switch to `phi3:medium` model (reduces to ~8-9 minutes on CPU)
- Increase worker replicas to 12+ (reduces to ~9 minutes on CPU)

Performance varies based on:
- CPU/GPU availability (GPU provides 2x speedup)
- Model size (smaller = faster: phi3:medium > llama3.1:8b)
- Network latency to Congress.gov API
- First run includes model download time (~4.7GB for llama3.1:8b)

## 🔒 Data Sources

All information comes exclusively from:
- **Congress.gov API** (https://api.congress.gov)
- Official bill pages
- Member profiles
- Committee information
